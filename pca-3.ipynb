    "Eigenvectors and eigenvalues are fundamental concepts in linear algebra, particularly in the context of matrices. Geometrically, eigenvectors represent the directions along which a linear transformation (represented by a matrix) only stretches or compresses the vector, without changing its direction. Eigenvalues, on the other hand, represent the factor by which the eigenvector is stretched or compressed along that direction.\n",

    "Eigen decomposition, also known as eigenvalue decomposition, is a fundamental concept in linear algebra with numerous real-world applications across various fields such as physics, engineering, computer science, and statistics. Some notable applications include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Eigen decomposition is extensively used in PCA, a statistical technique for reducing the dimensionality of data while preserving its variance. By computing the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix of the data, PCA identifies the principal components, which are linear combinations of the original variables that capture the most significant variations in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum Mechanics: In quantum mechanics, eigen decomposition plays a crucial role in solving Schrödinger's equation, which describes the behavior of quantum systems. The eigenvectors of operators representing physical observables correspond to the possible states of the system, while the corresponding eigenvalues represent the outcomes of measurements on those states.\n",
    "\n",
    "Structural Engineering: Eigen decomposition is utilized in structural engineering for analyzing the dynamic behavior of structures such as bridges and buildings. By modeling the structure as a system of masses and springs, the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the system's mass and stiffness matrices can be computed to determine its natural frequencies and mode shapes, which are essential for assessing its stability and response to external forces.\n",
    "\n",
    "Image and Signal Processing: Eigen decomposition finds applications in image and signal processing tasks such as denoising, compression, and feature extraction. Techniques like Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), a variant of eigen decomposition, are used for analyzing and manipulating images and signals, as well as for performing tasks like image compression in JPEG and data compression in various applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine Learning: Eigen decomposition is employed in various machine learning algorithms for tasks such as clustering, classification, and recommendation systems. For instance, in collaborative filtering-based recommendation systems, SVD is often used to decompose the user-item interaction matrix into lower-dimensional representations, facilitating efficient and accurate recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Control Systems: Eigen decomposition is applied in control theory for analyzing the stability and performance of dynamic systems. By computing the eigenvalues of the system's state matrix, engineers can determine the system's stability properties and design control strategies to achieve desired performance criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum Chemistry: Eigen decomposition is utilized in quantum chemistry for solving the electronic structure problem, which involves determining the energy levels and wavefunctions of electrons in molecules. Techniques like the Hartree-Fock method employ eigen decomposition to iteratively solve the electronic Schrödinger equation and approximate the molecular wavefunction.\n",

    "Yes, a matrix can have more than one set of eigenvectors and eigenvalues under certain conditions. Specifically, if a matrix is diagonalizable, it can have multiple sets of eigenvectors and eigenvalues. Diagonalizability occurs when a matrix A can be expressed as \n",
